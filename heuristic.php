    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        When no algorithm can be made that delivers an answer fast enough, and if the domain allows it, a heuristic can provide a solution that is <i>good enough</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A heuristic is a <i>rule of thumb</i> that is common in engineering. It provides a solution that is good enough in a specific case.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Heuristic - Nearest Neighbor
        <li>Anti-virus software tries to find viruses by pattern matching
    </ul>

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When a rigourous algorithm is too slow
        <li>When an inexact, yet good enough, solution is acceptable
    </ul>
