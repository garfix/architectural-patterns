    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
       When a client requests data, one of the replicas is selected to serve the request. This horizontal scaling allows the system to handle more concurrent reads. When a write is done to a replica, the replica must make sure that the update is synchronized with the other replicas.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data base replication
    </ul>

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When there are much more reads than writes and when the reads are big.
    </ul>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Synchronizing the updates is resource intensive
    </ul>
