    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        A template engine allows you to create a user interface free of presentation logic. All code needed to prepare the <b>data</b> that is to be shown is prepared separately. The <b>template</b> contains a declarative represention of the UI elements (for example: HTML elements), and has placeholder (for example in the form of double-curly braces <i>{{ some_data }}</i>) that will be replaced with part of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        When producing part of the UI (HTML, PDF, and others), the template engine is called to create a <b>page</b>, given a template and the precalculated data. It returns the UI (or part of it).
    </p>
    <p>
        Template engines are often part of frameoworks, but a number of them can be used independently.
    </p>

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Templates allow a designer to create the user interface without any knowledge or working implementation of the data model.
        <li>A user interface without presentation logic is easier to understand and maintain
    </ul>
