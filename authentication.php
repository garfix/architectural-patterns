    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        The user may provide a username and a password. The username represents their identity. The password proves that the identity is theirs.
    </p>

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you need the user to prove their identity because the resources provided should be accessible only to them.
    </ul>
