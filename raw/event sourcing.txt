Event Sourcing

It's a log of changes, but that's not all.

Fowler:
* Complete Rebuild: We can discard the application state completely and rebuild it by re-running the events from the event log on an empty application.
* We can determine the application state at any point in time.
* Event Replay: If we find a past event was incorrect, we can compute the consequences by reversing it and later events and then replaying the new event and later events.
