    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Decision trees are among the most popular machine learning algorithms given their intelligibility and simplicity. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If your data is structured and consists of scalar values
        <li>If you want to create a classifier based on labeled sample data
        <li>If you need your system to be transparent about the decisions it makes
    </ul>

    <p>
        Decision Tree Learning may be faster and easier than a neural network in some cases.
