    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        As an application programmer the details of the graphics card are abstracted away by a graphics API. The best known of these are DirectX and OpenGL. Use these to write software that's independent of the actual card the scene is displayed on.
    </p>
    <p>
        3D animations would require an incredible amount of CPU processing power, in stead they are performed by a specialized piece of hardware called the GPU (graphics programming unit). The GPU has its own memory, called VRAM.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some resources don't change and need to be uploaded to the GPU once, at the beginning of the game:
        <ul>
            <li>Vertex buffers
            <li>Index buffers
            <li>Textures
            <li>Shader programs
            <li>Render targets
            <li>Constant buffers
            <li>Structured buffers
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        For every following frame, the game calculates the new game state, including the positions of the vertices. This is all done by the CPU:
        <ul>
            <li>Collision Detection
            <li>Animation and Physics
            <li>Game Logic
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the new geometry is uploaded to the GPU, the GPU pipeline performs the following steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Vertex Generation
            <li>Vertex Processing
            <li>Primitive Generation
            <li>Primitive Processing
            <li>Fragment Generation / Rasterization
            <li>Fragment Processing
            <li>Pixel Operations
        </ul>
    </p>
