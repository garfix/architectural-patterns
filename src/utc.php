    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Th world has 24 time zones. Each of these zones has a different local time. Some countries use Daylight Savings Time, while others don't. UTC is a means of storing time in a standardized way. Storing all time values in a standard way resolves allows these values to be compared in a simple way.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example:
        <pre>1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        When local time is used, it's always important to realize that it belongs to a specific locale (with its time zone and dst).
    </p>

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <p>
        When your application spans multiple time zones, or even just multiple countries, and knowing the exact time of events is relevant.
