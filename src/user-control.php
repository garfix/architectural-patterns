    <p>
        The user needs to be in control of their data. This means that they should be able to perform any action they need and receive feedback on their actions.

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        User control has the following aspects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency: Common things should be easy. Complex things should be possible.
        <li>User centricity: the application should be built to best (most efficiently) serve the user, rather than reflect the database structure
        <li>Context: The application should be adapted to the device it runs on in a way that best serves the user
        <li>Undo / redo: whenever possible, allow a user to reverse an action (mistake) they made. Provide a "Cancel" button and an "Exit" button on a dialog
        <li>Feed-forward / feedback: it should be clear what consequence each action will have (feed-forward) and it should be clear what the effect of each action has been (feedback)
        <li>Introduce shortcuts for power users that work intensively with your application
    </ul>
