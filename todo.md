## problem solving

plain OO development?

* Markov Decision Process
* case-based reasoning
* data mining
* genetic algorithms
* decision trees
* support vector machines

* documentation
  * user manual
  * requirements
  * technical docs

## cross cutting

* routing / navigation

use case driven

ivar jacobson
    a use case must be an object

a system implements use cases

## data
* Object-Relational Mapping
* Liskov substitution principle
* Open Closed Principle

## the layer between programming paradigm and architecture
* Component based design
* Design by contract
* Object composition
* Domain driven design

## naming

* DDD: names from the domain
* code conventions

## a pattern is

* not a design method (ie DDD)
* not a principle (ie OCP)
* not a paradigm
* but it may be technique that comes from it

## programming

* mutable (functional) locks -> Immutability
* dependency inversion (polymorphism)

## interfaces

* liskov substitution principle
* dependency inversion (polymorphism)
* interface segregation principle

## application level?

* open / closed principle

## module

* module: cohesive combination of functions and data
* SRP

## deployment

* component

## presentation

* templating engine

## ?

* middleware

* boundary
* use-case
