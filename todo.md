Just some ideas

## problem solving

* just code: domain logic / business logic / ui etc

* Markov Decision Process
* case-based reasoning
* data mining
* genetic algorithms
* decision trees
* support vector machines

## documentation

  * user manual
  * requirements
  * technical docs

## cross cutting

* routing / navigation: name a specific nav. scheme

## dependencies

* dependency injection
* dependency graph https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph

* data
  * relational
  * sparse distributed
  * NoSQL

## presentation

* graphical design

* menu
* search
* path, backtrack (?)
* categories

## data

* Object-Relational Mapping
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern
*
## the layer between programming paradigm and architecture

* Component based design
* Design by contract
* Object composition
* Domain driven design

## naming

* DDD: names from the domain
* code conventions

## a pattern is

* not a design method (ie DDD)
* not a principle (ie OCP)
* not a paradigm
* an engineering technique

## programming

* mutable (functional) locks -> Immutability
* dependency inversion (polymorphism)

## module

* module: cohesive combination of functions and data
* SRP

## deployment

* component

## presentation

* templating engine

## and ...

* middleware
* software versions
