    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>ETL</b> is used to integrate <b>data sources</b> into the data warehouse. From there, the data is moved to specialized databases.

        A <b>data mart</b> is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject (or functional area), hence they draw data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Business Intelligence (BI)
    </ul>

    <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you need a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source
    </ul>
